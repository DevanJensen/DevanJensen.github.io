    <h1>If Statements in JavaScript</h1>
    <h3>CONTROL STRUCTURES - IF STATEMENTS</h3>
    <p>
        We use <b>if statements</b> to <b>control the flow of code execution</b> in JavaScript. 
        For example, if a certain condition is true, then we may want some code to run. 
        But if it is false, then we may want some other code to run.
    </p>
    <p>
        An <b>if statement</b> is known as a <b>control structure</b>. There are other control structures in JavaScript, we'll learn more about them soon.
    </p>
    <p>Here is the syntax for writing an IF statement:</p>
    <pre>
if(boolean expression goes here){

  // the code inside these curly braces
  // will run if the boolean expression
  // evaluates to true

}
    </pre>
    <p>
    Before we continue, please take a moment to notice the syntax (remember that mastering the syntax of a language is one of the biggest hurdles to a beginning programmer). 
    We have the keyword 'if' followed by a boolean expression that is enclosed within parenthesis (we'll discuss boolean expressions next).
    Also notice that directly after the closing parenthesis, we have an opening curly brace. 
    The matching closing curly brace marks the end of this IF statement. 
    You will put code in between the opening and closing curly braces.
    This code will be executed if the boolean expression evaluates to true. 
    </p>
    <p>
    Beginning programmers must pay extremely close attention to parenthesis and curly braces.
    They always come in pairs (for example, every opening curly brace will have a corresponding closing curly brace).
    It's a common mistake for beginning programmers to forget an opening or closing curly brace, which can lead to bugs and frustration.
    </p>
    <p>
      If it helps you to keep track of the curly braces, it may be helpful for you to put the opening curly brace
      on a new line so that it is vertically aligned with its matching closing curly brace.
    </p>
    <pre>
if(boolean expression goes here)
{

  // the code inside these curly braces
  // will run if the boolean expression
  // evaluates to true

}
    </pre>
    <h3>Boolean Expressions</h3>
    <p>
        You might be wondering what a <b>boolean expression</b> is. Remember we talked about expressions in a previoius class. An expression can be evaluated to a result. For example the expression 6 + 5 can be 
        evaluated to a result of 11. A boolean expression evaluates to TRUE or FALSE. Here is a boolean expression:
        <br><br> 
        5 > (3+1)
        <br><br>
        Does this boolean expression evaluate to TRUE, or FALSE? Let's try it out!
    </p>
    <pre>
if( 5 > (3+1) ){
  alert("Yup! The boolean expression evaluates to true, which is why this alert code is running right now!");
}
    </pre>
    <h3>IF/ELSE Statements</h3>
    <p>
        In the example above, we only ran code (showing an alert) if the boolean expression evaluated to true. 
        But we often want to run different code if the boolean expression evaluates to false.
        In that case we can use a slightly different form of an if statement, known as an <b>IF/ELSE statement</b>.
        Here's the syntax for an IF/ELSE statement:
    </p>
    <pre>
if(boolean expression goes here){

  // the code inside these curly braces
  // will run if the boolean expression
  // evaluates to TRUE

}else{
  
  // the code inside these curly braces
  // will run if the boolean expression
  // evaluates to FALSE

}
    </pre>
    <p>
        Let's make a little game program that uses an if/else control structure:
    </p>
    <pre>
var guess = prompt("Who was the first president of the U.S.?");

if( guess == "George Washington" ){
  alert("Correct! You win!");
}else{
  alert("Sorry, you lose!");
}
    </pre>
    <p>
    <h3>VERY IMPORTANT...</h3>
    Note that the boolean expression uses two equal signs. 
    Remember that a single equal sign is known as the <b>assignment operator</b>, and is used to assign a value to a variable.
    So we can't use the assignment operator in our boolean expression because JavaScript would get confused (are we assiging a value to 'guess' or are we comparing the value of 'guess' to see if it is equal to 'George Washington'?).
    To avoid this confusion, we use two equal signs. 
    These two equals signs together are known as the <b>equality operator</b>.
    We'll be talking more about various other operators in JavaScript soon.
    </p>
    <h3>Formatting IF Statments by Indenting</h3>
    <p>Let's review the proper syntax for defining your own function in JavaScript:</p>
    <pre>
function someFunctionName(){
  // code that runs when you use the function
  // goes here, in the body of the function (inside the curly braces)
}
    </pre>
    <p>
    Notice how the code inside the body of the function is indented. This makes our code easy to read
    and it makes it easy to see where the code for the function begins and ends. If we did not
    indent this code, it could be easy to scroll right past the entire function without clearly seeing where it ends
    and where the code after the function begins.
    </p>
    <p>
    We need to follow the same formatting for If statements. The code inside the curly braces
    of an if statement should be indented, to make it easy to see which code is 'nested' inside the if statement.
    This makes it much easier to understand what lines of code will run for each boolean expression in the IF statement.
    Take a moment to look at all the IF statements that are presented on the page and notice how the code is indented for each one of them.
    </p>
    <h3>IF/Else-If Statements</h3>
    <p>With IF and IF/ELSE statements you are only evaluating one boolean expression 
    (another way to say this is that 'you are only evaluating one true/false condition').
    In a previous code snippet we ask a user to enter the name of the first U.S. president. 
    Our IF statement checks only one condition; whether or not the answer entered is true or false.
    </p>
    <p> 
    We can use another variation of IF statements to deal with more than one possible condition.
    Let's say we ask the user to enter a color. If the color they enter is red, then our program does one thing.
    If the color they enter is blue, then our program does something else. And if the color they enter is yellow, our
    program does yet another thing. Finally, if they enter any other color (something other than red, blue, or yellow), our program does yet another thing.
    </p>
    <p>Here's what that code might look like:</p>
    <pre>
var color = prompt("Enter a color (use all lower case letters please - JS is case sensitive.");

if(color == "red"){
  alert("Ah yes, the color of roses!");
}else if(color == "blue"){
  alert("What's the matter? Not feeling well today?");
}else if(color == "yellow"){
  alert("That's hot!");
}else{
  alert("Not sure what to tell you, but you didn't enter 'red', 'blue', or 'yellow'.");
}
    </pre>
    <p>Notice the the final 'else' does not include 'if', and it does not include a boolean expression.
    The code inside the curly braces following this last 'else' will run if none of the prevsious boolean expressions are true.
    <p>
      Here is the syntax for an if/else-if control structure:
    <pre>
if(first boolean expression goes here){
  
  // this code runs if the first boolean expression is true
  // and then code execution will go directly to the alert() below;

}else if(second boolean expression goes here){

  // this code runs if the second boolean expression is true
  // and then code execution will go directly to the alert() below;

}else{

  // this code runs if neither of the first nor the second 
  // boolean expressions are true
  // and then code execution will go directly to the alert() below;

}

alert("The IF statement has completed!");
    </pre>
    <p>
      A very important concept to understand about IF statements is that only one 'branch' of code will execute.
      Each pair of curly braces encloses a 'code branch'.
      Consider this strange example: 
    </p>
    <pre>
var age = 9;

if(age < 10){
  alert("age is less than 10");
}else if(age < 20){
  alert("age is less than 20");
}
    </pre>
    <p>
    In this example, both boolean expressions evaluate to true. 
    If statements will execute the code branch for the first boolean expression that evaluates to true.
    So in this case an alert message will display "age is less than 10".
    As long as the value of age is 9, the second code branch will never execute.
    </p>
    <p>
      It's absolutely mandatory for a programmer to understand how these variations of IF statements work.
      It takes some practice get a feel for the nuances between them. 
    <p>
    Notice again how the code is indented within each part of the entire IF statement.
    It's extremely important to follow good formatting rules when writing code so that you, 
    and other programmers can easily read it.
    </p>
    <h3>Nested If Statements</h3>
    <p>
        These variations of the if statement can be nested as well. Consider this algorithm:
    </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
          If the user likes books, ask them if they like Sci Fi books:
          <ul>
              <li>If the user likes Sci Fi books, then recommend Frankenstein.</li>
              <li>If the user does NOT like Sci Fi books, then recommend Gone With the Wind.</li>
          </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
          If the user does NOT like books, then ask them if they like movies.
          <ul>
              <li>If the user likes movies, then recommend the movie Social Networking.</li>
              <li>If the user does NOT like movies, then recommend that they take up knitting.</li>
          </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Here's how we can write code for the algorithm:</p>
    <pre>
var likesBooks = prompt("Do you like books (enter 'yes' or 'no')?");

if(likesBooks == "yes"){
  // the user likes books...

  var likesSciFi = prompt("Do you like Sci Fi books [enter 'yes' or 'no']?");
  
  if(likesSciFi == "yes"){
    alert("I recommend Frankenstein!");
  }else{
    alert("I recommend Gone With the Wind!");
  }

}else if(likesBooks == "no"){
  // the user does NOT like books...

  var likesMovies = prompt("Do you like movies (enter 'yes' or 'no')?");
  
  if(likesMovies == "yes"){
    alert("I recommend Social Networking!");
  }else{
    alert("I recommend knitting!");
  }

}else{

  alert("It was a yes/no question! And remember that JS is case sensitive!");

}
    </pre>
    
    <h3>Controlling the Flow</h3>
    <p>
      You can use variations of the IF statement to control the flow of your program.
      This will determine what lines of code run and which lines will not run when your program is used.
    </p>
    <p>
      Understanding how to control the flow of a program is hugely important.
      But in order to know how to control the flow, you must understand the problem that you are 
      trying to solve with your program. So make sure to take the time to understand the problem before you dive into writing the code.
