    <h1>Operators</h1>
    <p>
        We have already discussed the <b>assignment operator</b> and the <b>equality operator</b>, but there are many others in JavaScript.
        They can be grouped into the following categories:
    </p>
    <table border="1">
      <tr>
        <td><b>Arithmetic Opertators</b></td>
        <td>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;+ <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;- <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;/ <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;%&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;modulus operator<br><br>
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><b>Short-cut Arithmetic Opertators</b></td>
        <td>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;+= <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;-= <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;*= <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;/= <br><br>
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><b>Increment and Decrement Opertators</b></td>
        <td>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;++&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;increment operator<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;--&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;decrement operator<br><br>
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><b>Comparison Operators</b></td>
        <td>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt; <br>  
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&gt; <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;= <br>

            &nbsp;&nbsp;!=&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;inequality operator<br> 
            &nbsp;&nbsp;===&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;strict equality operator<br><br>
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><b>Logical Opertators</b></td>
        <td>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&amp;&amp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(AND)<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;||&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(OR)<br><br>
        </td>

    </table>
    <h1>Arithmetic Operators</h1>
    <p>
      You already know how arithmetic operators work in math, so we don't need to talk much about the arthmetic operators.
      Although, there is one that may need some explanation, the 'modulus' operator!
    <p>
    <h3>The Modulus Operator</h3>
    <p>The modulus operator is used to determine the remainder from dividing the first number by the second number.</p>
    <pre>
// The Modulus Operator (finds the remainder)
var someRemainder = 7 % 2;
alert(someRemainder); // the alert will show 1
    </pre>
    <h3>Short-cut Arithmetic Operators</h3>
    <p>
        The short-cut operators just save you from doing a little extra typing.
        As a beginner, these operators may just confuse you at first, but as you get more experience
        you'll get to be more comfortable with them. These operators allow you to write more concise code
        but you could just as easily use the long-hand version and your program will run exactly the same.
    </p>
    <pre>
var x = 3;

x += 2;     //same as x = x + 2
x -= 2;     //same as x = x - 2
x /= 2;     //same as x = x / 2
x *= 2;     //same as x = x * 2
    </pre>
    <h3>Concatenating Strings</h3>
    <p>
        The addition operator has another purpose in JavaScript. 
        Not only can it be used for adding numbers, it can also be used for joining strings together.
        In programming, joining strings together is known as <b>concatenating</b>.
        You will be hearing this term a lot in your programming career.
    </p>
    <pre>
var str1 = "Hi";
var str2 = "there";
alert(str1 + " " + str2);
    </pre>
    <p>
    You can also use the the short-cut addition operator when concatenating strings.
    Here's an example that creates a string that represents an HTML table:
    </p>
    <pre>
var html =    "&lt;table&gt;";
html +=           "&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;x&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;";
html +=           "&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;x&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;";
html +=           "&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;x&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;";
html +=       "&lt;/table&gt;";

alert("Here's some HTML:\n" + html);
    </pre>
    <h3>The Increment and Decrement Operators</h3>
    <p>
    The increment and decrement operators are also another type of short-cut operator.
    They simply increase a value by 1, or decrease a value by one.
    </p>
    <pre>
var x = 7;

x++; 
console.log("The value of x is " + x);

x--;
console.log("The value of x is " + x);
    </pre>
    <p>
    Note that you could easily use the long-hand version to add or subtract 1 from a number.
    But you'll soon find out when we learn about loops, that it's such a common task to add or remove 1 from a number
    that the short-cuts come in handy.
    </p>

    <h1>Comparison Operators</h1>
    <p>
        We use comparison operators in <b>boolean expressions</b>.
        You have probably have already seen many of these operators in math.
    </p>
    <p>
        Here is an IF statement in which the boolean expression check to see if the value of x is greater than or equal to 5:
    </p>
    <pre>
if(x >= 5){
  alert("x is greater than or equal to 5!");
}
    </pre>
    <h3>The Equality Operator</h3>
    <p>
        Remember that a single equals sign is the 'assignment' operator, it is used to assign a value to a variable.
        To see if two values are the same we use the 'equality' operator, which is two equals signs next to each other:&nbsp; <b>==</b>.
    </p>
    <pre>
if(x == 5){
  alert("Yes it's true, x is equal to 5!");
}else{
   alert("x is NOT equal to 5!"); 
}
    </pre>
    <p>You can use the equality operator to compare strings as well as numbers, but remember that JavaScript is case-sensitive.</p>
    <pre>   
var guess = prompt("Guess what word I'm thinking of.");

if(guess == "operators"){
  alert("Good guess!");
}
    </pre>
    <h3>Comparing for Inequality</h3>
    <p>
    Sometimes we want to compare values to see it they are NOT equal.
    </p>
    <pre>
var myName = "Bob";
var yourName = prompt("What is your first name?");

if(myName != yourName){
  alert("We have different names!");
}
    </pre>
    <h3>The Strict Equality Operator (===)</h3>
    <p>
        We know that variables can store different types of data (number, string, boolean, etc.).
        Consider what happens if we store the number 7 in a variable, and if we store the string "7" in another variable.
        The <b>value</b> of each variable is the same (they both store the value 7), but one is a string
        and the other is a number. We can use the <b>strict equality operator</b> to compare both the value and the type of two variables.
    </p>
    <pre>
var someNumber = 7;
var someString = "7";

if(someNumber == someString){
    alert("They have the same VALUE...");
}

if(someNumber === someString){
    alert("They have the same VALUE...and they are the same DATA TYPE");
}
    </pre>
    <p>
        Here's a good example that demonstrates that in programming languages, 0 and false are considered to be the same (even though they have different data types).
    </p>
    <pre>
var a = 0;
var b = false;

if(a == b){
    alert("They have the same value");
}

if(a === b){
    alert("They have the same value and they are the same data type");
}
    </pre>
    <h1>Logical Operators</h1>
    <h3>The AND operator <b>&amp;&amp;</b></h3>
    <p>
    We use logical operators to combine two or more boolean expressions.
    For example, if we wanted to see if a number was between two other numbers, we could use the 'AND' opertator, which is two ampersands next to each other.
    </p>
    <pre>
var x = parseInt(prompt("Enter a number:"));
var min = 1;
var max = 10;

if(x >= min && x <= max){
  alert( x + " is within " + min + " and " + max);
}

// Note: things that get entered into a prompt window are assumed to be strings
// so we can use the built-in parseInt() function to TRY to convert it to a number data type
    </pre>
    <p>When you combine two boolean expressions by using the AND operator, then result will be true only if both expressions are true.</p>
    <h3>The OR operator <b>||</b></h3>
    <p>
        If you use the OR operator to combine two boolean expressions in an IF statement, the 
        statement will evaluate to true if either of the boolean expressions is true. 
    </p>
    <pre>
var temperature = 75;
var rain = true;
var whatToDo;

if(temperature < 60 || rain){
    whatToDo = "stay home";    
}else{
    whatToDo = "play golf";
}

alert("Let's " + whatToDo);
    </pre>
    <p>
    It might look a little funny that the second boolean expression in the above if statement is simply the variable 'rain'.
    But note that 'rain' evaluates to true because it was initialized to true before the IF statement.
    </p>
    <p>Here's another example...</p>
    <pre>
var joeLikesProgramming = true;
var bettyLikesProgramming = false;
var sallyLikesProgramming = true;

if(joeLikesProgramming && sallyLikesProgramming){
  alert("Joe AND Sally like programming!");
}

if(bettyLikesProgramming || sallyLikesProgramming){
  alert("Betty OR Sally likes programming!");
}
    </pre>
