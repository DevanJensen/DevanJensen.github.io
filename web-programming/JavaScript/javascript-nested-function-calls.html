    <h1>Nested Function Calls</h1>
    <p>In math, when we see lots of parenthesis used in expressions, we evaluate them from the inside out:</p>
    <pre>
x = (7 * (4 * (5 + 3) + 3))
    </pre>
    <p>
    When functions return values, you might see them used inside of other function calls (nested function call).
    In the previous page (JavaScript Operators) I may have surprised you with some strange code that looked like this:
    </p>
    <pre>
var x = parseInt(prompt("Enter a number:"));
    </pre>
    <p>
    If a function returns a value, it can be nested inside another function call when you invoke it.
    The return value of the nested function call will become the parameter for the outer function call.
    </p>
    <pre>
function padWithDashes(str){
    return "---" + str + "---";
}

var someString = prompt("Enter something.");
alert(padWithDashes(someString));
    </pre>
    <p>
        First, we declare a function that takes a string parameter and concatenates dashes before and after the parameter.
        It also returns the final concatenated string.
        Then we prompt the user to enter a string and store the response in someString.
    </p>
    <p>
        The final line is what we are interested in, here we see 'nested' function calls.
        The return value of the call to padWithDashes() is passed as the parameter to alert().
    </p>
    <p>
        There is a script on line 11 of this file, go ahead and try it out.
    </p>
    <p>
        We could actually condense this code even more. See if you can wrap your mind around this code:
    </p>
    <pre>
alert(padWithDashes(prompt("Enter something.")));
    </pre>
    <p>
    Just remember that nested function calls are evaluated from the inside out.
    That is, the inner most function call is executed first and it's return value
    is passed as the parameter to the next function call.
    </p>
    <p>
    Also remember that you when you nest function calls like this, they should be functions that return a value.
