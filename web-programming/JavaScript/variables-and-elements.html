    <!--Notice that the H1 tag on line 14 has an 'id' attribute set to 'mainH1'-->
    <h1 id="mainH1">JavaScript variables that hold HTML elements</h1>
    <p>
        We previously talked about variables and data types in JavaScript.
        So you should know what a variable is, and you should know that variables can 'hold'
        different data types, such as numbers, strings, booleans, etc.. 
        You should also know what it means to <b>declare</b> and <b>initialize</b> a variable. 
    </p>
    <p>
        You can also use variables to hold HTML elements that are on your page (remember that 'element' and 'tag' are interchangeable terms).
        This is one of the most useful things you can do in JavaScript, and it allows you to manipulate
        the HTML tags/elements on your page.
        When you have a variable that holds an HTML element, we often say that you have a 'handle' on the element.
        The variable itself is the handle, and we can use it to manipulate the HTML element.
    </p>
    <p>
        There are various ways in JavaScript to 'get a handle' on an element, but a common approach is to use the <b>id</b> attribute of the element.
        If you look at the HTML code for this page, you'll see that on line 14 the H1 tag has an <b>id</b> attribute set to 'mainH1'.
    </p>
    <p>    
        Here is one way to get a handle on that H1 tag by referring to the value of its id attribute:
    </p>
    <pre>
var myElement = document.getElementById("mainH1");        
    </pre>
    <p>
        At this point, don't worry about the details of he code on the right side of the equals sign, just understand that it initializes the variable <b>myElement</b> to hold the H1 tag in this page.
        And understand that we are able to get a handle on that specific H1 tag by referring to the value of its id attribute (which is 'mainH1').
        When you have a variable that holds an HTML element, you can start to manipulate that element with your JavaScript code.
    </p>
    <h3>Activity</h3>
    <p>
        For this activity you are going to copy a snippet of JavaScript code that declares and initializes a variable to hold the H1 tag on this page.
        The variable (myElement) will be our 'handle' on the H1 tag.
        Then we'll use the variable to manipulate the H1 tag.
    </p>
    <p>
        Look at the code for this page, and notice that under the image below, there is an empty <b>script</b> tag.
        Copy the code you see in the image by typing it in between the opening and closing script tags.
        The code will change the text inside the H1 tag, then it will change some of the colors in the H1 tag.
        If you run your code and it doesn't do these things, then take another look at the image and see if you can find any errors in your code.
    </p>
    <p>
        Here is an image of the code that you are going to type...
