    <h1>Objects and Functions</h1>
    <h3>Objects as Parameters</h3>
    <p>Just like other data types, objects can be used as parameters when invoking functions.</p>
    <p>
        In the following example we will create an object that represents a students record for a class
        (suppose that we are writing a program to keep track of grades in a class, the final grade depends on only two exams, the mid term exam and the final exam).
    </p>
    <pre>
var student1 = {name: "Sally", midTermExam:85, finalExam: 92};
    </pre>
    <p>
    Next we create a function that can calculate a student's average grade:
    </p>
    <pre>
function calculateStudentAverage(studentObj){
    var avg = (studentObj.midTermExam + studentObj.finalExam)/2;
    return avg;
}
    </pre>
    <p>
    Finally, we can invoke the function and pass in student1 as a paramter.
    </p>
    <pre>
var student1Avg = calculateStudentAverage(student1);
console.log(student1Avg);
    </pre>
    <p>
        In this example, the function expects an object as a parameter, and it uses the midTermExam and the finalExam
        properties of the object to calculate the student's average score for the class.
        So the function not only expects an object as a parameter, it also expects that object to have properties named midTermExam and finalExam.
        If we made a mistake, and used an object that doesn't have a midTermExam or finalExam property, we would find that our program will not work correctly.
        We could address this by adding code that checks the object parameter, but we'll save that for later.
    </p>
    <p>
        This example program is pretty crude, but it demonstrates a powerful pattern that is often used in programming.
        Remember that most programs are written in order to work with data, and that we can create objects to represent the data we need to work with.
        In this example we've seen how you can use objects and function to process data in your programs.
    </p>
    <h3>Objects as Return Values</h3>
    <p>
        We've already learned that functions may have return values. 
        Those return values can be any data type, including objects.
    </p>
    <p>
        Let's assume that we are creating a program that works with graphics, and we need to draw a bunch of rectangles.
        Let's also assume that we need to change the size of rectangles, so we write a function that takes a rectangle object as parameter, and another parameter that indicates scale the new rectangle.
        The function returns a new rectangle object whose size will be based on the parameters.
    </p>
    <pre>
function makeResizedRect(rect, multiplier){

    var resizedRect = {
        width: rect.width * multiplier,
        height: rect.height * multiplier
    };

    return resizedRect;
}

// create an object that represents a rectangle...
var myRect = {width:20, height:50};

// use myRect as a parameter to call makeResizedRect()
var newRect = makeResizedRect(myRect, 2);
console.log(newRect);
    </pre>

    /*
    Problem:
    Create a function that calculates the final grade for a student.
    (We created a function that calculates the average score, but not the final grade).
    The parameter that gets passed into this function should be an object that represents a student.
    Assume the same structure for student objects that we used earlier - name, midTermExam, finalExam.
    BE CAREFUL - property names in JavaScript are CASE SENSITIVE.
    In the body of the function write code that determines the average score of the two exams,
    then use an IF statement to determine the student's letter grade for the course.
    Grades are determined like so:

    A = 90 - 100
    B = 80 - 89
    C = 70 - 79
    D = 60 - 69
    F = 59 or lower
    
    Note that the function will return a string value (the letter grade based on the students average test score).
    
    After you define the function, then create a few student objects to use for testing your function.
    */
    
    function calculateStudentGrade(studentObj){
    var avg = (studentObj.midTermExam + studentObj.finalExam)/2;
    var lettergrade = "F";
    if(avg >= 90) {
        letterGrade = "A";
    }else if(avg >=80) {
        letterGrade = "B";
    }else if(avg >=70) {
        letterGrade = "C";
    }else if(avg >=60) {
        letterGrade = "D";
    }

    return letterGrade;
    }

    var bob = {name:"bob", midTermExam:75, finalExam:100};
    var finalGrade = calculateStudentGrade(bob);
    console.log(finalGrade);
