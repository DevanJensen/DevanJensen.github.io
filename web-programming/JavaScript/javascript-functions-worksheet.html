    <h1>JavaScript Functions</h1>
    <p><b>Functions</b> are reusable groups of commands. You can think of them as mini programs within your program.</p>
    <p>Let's say we had to convert 10 numbers from celsius to fahrenheit, we could do this...</p>
    <pre>
// convert a bunch of degrees celsius to farhenheit
var f1 = 10 * 9/5 + 32;
var f2 = 50 * 9/5 + 32;
var f3 = 75 * 9/5 + 32;
var f4 = 100 * 9/5 + 32;
//....and so on
    </pre>
    <p>But notice how much duplicate code we have written above (repeating code can lead to bugs!).</p>
    <p>Let's create a function that converts celsius to farhenheit...</p>
    <pre>
function convertToFarhenheit(tempCelsius){
  var tempFarhenheit = tempCelsius * 9/5 + 32;
  return tempFarhenheit;
}
    </pre>
    <p>Note that we start the function definition with 'function', which is a keyword in JavaScript.</p>
    <p>Then comes the function name, we can pick any name for the function, but there are some guidelines, for example function names cannot begin with a number.</p> 
    <p>
        After the name we put parenthesis.
        Inside the parenthesis is the <b>parameter</b>, you can use parameters to feed input into your function.
        Note that the name of the parameter in this example is 'tempCelsius'.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <b>body</b> of the function goes in between the curly braces.
        The code that we write in the body of the function will run whenever we use the function.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the body of the function, we take the parameter and use it in the expression to convert celsius to fahrenheit.
        Then we <b>return</b> the result. So, parameters allow us to convert any temperature to fahrenheit, which
        makes this function very flexible. We can pass in any value as a parameter and the function will convert it to degress fahrenheit.
    </p>
    <p>
        We have <b>defined/declared</b>, a function, but we have not yet used it, let's use it now...
    </p>
    <pre>
var f1 = convertToFarhenheit(10);
var f2 = convertToFarhenheit(50);
var f3 = convertToFarhenheit(75);

// lets show the results in the log
console.log(f1);
console.log(f2);
console.log(f3);
    </pre>
    <p>
        Using a function is called <b>invoking</b>, or <b>calling</b> it.
        In the code sample above, we invoked convertToFahrenheit() three times.
    </p>
    <p>
        Again, notice how we can pass in any value as the parameter, 
        and in the body of the function we refer to this value by the name of the parameter (in this case, the parameter is named 'tmpCelsius').
    </p>
    <p>
    Also note that the <b>return value</b> of the function gets assigned as the value of a variable.
    The third line in the code sample above calls/invokes the convertToFarhenheit() function by passing in 75 and assigning the result (the return value) to the variable f3.
    When a function returns a value, that value is often assigned to a variable.<br>For example: <b> var result = someFunction();</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
    We created the function convertToFarhenheit(), but JavaScript has many functions built into it that we can use, for example <b>alert()</b>, <b>console.log()</b>, and <b>prompt()</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
    Note that you can pass a variable into a function as a parameter: 
    </p>
    <pre>
var celsiusToday = prompt("What's the temp today (in celsius)?");

var fahrenheitToday = convertToFarhenheit(celsiusToday);

alert("Today's temp in farhenheit is: " + fahrenheitToday);
    </pre>
    <p>
        In the above code sample, we prompt the user to enter today's temperature in celsius,
        then we store his/her answer in a variable named celsiusToday. Then we feed the variable into the function as a parameter.
    </p>

    <p>Functions can take more than one parameter:</p>
    <pre>
// first we define a function...

function someUselessFunction(param1, param2){
  alert("You passed in the following params:\n" + param1 + "\n" + param2);
}


// then we use it (by <b>calling</b> or <b>invoking</b> it)...

someUselessFunction("sugar", "spice"); 
    </pre>
    <p>
    Note that functions do not have to have parameters.
    Also note that functions do not always return something.
    </p>
    <pre>
// here we define a function that has no parameters. 
// it also does not return a value...

function doSomething(){
  alert("I'm doing something....(maybe).");
}


// lets call/invoke the function here...
doSomething();
    </pre>
    <p>
    Note that even if a function doesn't have any parameters, you must still include the ()
    when you invoke/call it.
    </p>

    // JavaScript code goes here, inside a script tag

    // first we define a function...

    <h1>Questions - JavaScript Functions</h1>
    <h4>Question 1</h4>
    <p class="question">
        What is a function, and why would you ever want to use one in your code?
    </p>
    <div class="answer">
        A function is a set of commands which are called for when needed. They should be used so you don't need to have the command retyped multiple times.
    </div>

    <h4>Question 2</h4>
    <p class="question">
        What do you call the 'inputs' that get passed into a function?
    </p>
    <div class="answer">
        They are called parameters.
    </div>

    <h4>Question 3</h4>
    <p class="question">
        Do all functions have return values?
    </p>
    <div class="answer">
        Not all functions need to return values.
    </div>

    <h4>Question 4</h4>
    <p class="question">
    What is the 'body' of a function, and what are the characters that enclose the body of a function?
    </p>
    <div class="answer">
        The body of the function is where the commands that will be executed are placed. it is inserted between [ ].
    </div>

    <h4>Question 5</h4>
    <p class="question">
        What does it mean to 'invoke' a function?
    </p>
    <div class="answer">
        To invoke a function means to call the function and execute it.
    </div>

    <h4>Question 6</h4>
    <p class="question">
        What does it mean to 'call' a function?
    </p>
    <div class="answer">
        Call is used to change or assign a value when executing the function.
    </div>

    <h4>Question 7</h4>
    <p class="question">
        If a function has more than one parameter, what character do you use to separate those parameters?
    </p>
    <div class="answer">
        You use an comma to seperate parameters.
    </div>

    <h4>Question 8</h4>
    <p class="question">
        What is the problem with this code (explain the syntax error)?
        <pre>
function convertKilometersToMiles(km)
    return km * 0.6217;
}
        </pre>
    </p>
    <div class="answer">
        The function does not have the opening curly bracket({).
    </div>

    box appear that simply says "Hello!"

    After you declare the function, invoke it.

    /*
    // Problem 2 - A function that takes a parameter
    Declare a function called greetUser.
    The function should have one parameter called userName.
    In the body of the function, write a line of code shows
    an alert box that says "Greetings" concatenated to the userName.
    For example, if the userName parameter is set to "Bob",
    then the alert box should say "Greetings Bob".

    Invoke the function after the declaration.
    */

    // Problem 3 - A function that has a return value
    Declare a function called addNumbers.
    It should have two parameters, called n1 and n2.
    In the body of the function, write an expression that
    adds n1 and n2 and returns the sum.

    After the declaration, invoke the function and assign the 
    return value to a variable called 'total'.
    Then log the total.
    For example: 
        var total = addNumbers(3,5);
