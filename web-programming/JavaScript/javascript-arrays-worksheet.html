    <h1>JavaScript Arrays</h1>
    <h3>An array is a collection of data.</h3>
    <p>
      When we write programs, we often need to work with collections of data.
      For example, you probably wouldn't write a program to keep track of a single book,
      instead it would be more useful to keep track of a collection of books 
      (maybe you are building software for a public library).
    </p>
    <p>
      JavaScript, like many other programming languages, allows us to work with collections of data by using <b>arrays</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
      In previous lessons, we have used variables to store a single piece of data, such as a number, string, or boolean.
      (although you might argue that we used variables to contain objects that can store multiple properties, these variables still referred to a single object).
      Arrays allow us to use a single variable to store multiple values, consider this example:
    </p>    
    <pre>
var myTestScores = [96, 85, 89, 77];
    </pre>
    <p>
      This is an array of numbers.
      Let's take a minute to discuss the syntax used to create this array.
      Notice that there are square brackets enclosing the array <b>[]</b>. 
      And notice that the items in the array are separated by commas.
    </p>
    <p>
      The previous code sample demonstrates and array that stores numbers.
      Here's one that stores strings:
    </p>
    <pre>
var myFriends = ["Joe", "Betty", "Sally"];
console.log(myFriends);
    </pre>
    <p>
      Some languages require that arrays store values that are the same data type.
      But JavaScript allows you to mix data types within an array.
    </p>
    <pre>
var mixedArray = [6, "bob", false];
    </pre>
    <h3>Array Indices</h3>
    <p>
      The values stored in an array are called <b>elements</b> (not to be confused with elements in HTML).
      The mixed array above stores 3 elements.
    </p>
    <p> 
      Each element in an array has a specific position, which is known as the <b>index</b> of the element.
      For example, in the mixed array above, the first element (the value 6) has an index of 0
      Array indexes start at 0 in most programming languages, this is something that can trip up beginners, but with enough practice, you'll quickly get used to this.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can retreive values out of an array by using it's index with bracket notation. 
    </p>
    <pre>
var myTestScores = [96, 85, 89, 77];
var firstTest = myTestScores[0];
var secondTest = myTestScores[1];
var thirdTest = myTestScores[2];
var fourthTest = myTestScores[3];
    </pre>
    <p>
      Again, be careful to remember that the first element has an index of 0.
    </p>
    <p>
      We can also change values in an array by using bracket notation and an index:
    </p>
    <pre>
var myTestScores = [96, 85, 89, 77];
console.log(myTestScores);

myTestScores[3] = 100;
console.log(myTestScores);
    </pre>

    <p>
    It's common to start with an empty array and build it up as the program runs.
    Notice in the code sample below, that we start with an empty array, and then we use indexes and bracket notation to add elements to the array.
    </p>
    <pre>
var testScores = [];
testScores[0] = prompt("Enter your first test score.");
testScores[1] = prompt("Enter your second test score.");
testScores[2] = prompt("Enter your third test score.");
console.log(testScores);
    </pre>
    <h3>Arrays are Objects</h3>
    <p>
      Arrays are actually a special type of object, and like other objects, they have properties and methods that we can use.
      We'll talk more about array methods later, but for now let's go over the <b>length</b> property of an array.
      The length property will tell us how many elements are in an array.
      Note that the length will always be one greater than the highest index in an array. 
      This makes sense when you remember that the index of the first element is 0. 
    </p>
    <pre>
var myTestScores = [96, 85, 89, 77];
console.log(myTestScores.length);
    </pre>
    <p>
      You can use the length property when you want to add an element to an array. 
    </p>
    <pre>
var myFriends = ["Betty", "Sally", "Bob"];
myFriends[myFriends.length] = "Pat";
    </pre>
    <p>
      In class we can discuss why this approach can be better than using an index number to add an element to an array.
      Likewise, we can always get the last element from an array like this:
    </p>
    <pre>
var myFriends = ["Betty", "Sally", "Bob"];
var myLastFriend = myFriends[myFriends.length - 1];
console.log(myLastFriend);
    </pre>
    <p>
      In the previous two examples we've put expressions in between the brackets rather than values.
      These expressions will be evaluated and the result will be used as the index of the array to fetch.
      For example, the expression <b>myFriends.length - 1</b> evaluates to 2.
      So myLastFriend will contain the value "Bob".
    </p>
    <p>
      The point is that you can put expressions inside the brackets, and they will be evaluated to an index number.
      The is a very powerful feature of arrays, as we'll soon see.
      Can you figure out what the following program does?
    </p>
    <pre>
var myFriends = ["Betty", "Sally", "Bob"];

var x = prompt("Enter a valid index number for the myFriends array");
var selectedElement = myFriends[x];

if(selectedElement){
  console.log("The value of the element at index " + x + " is: " + selectedElement);
}else{
  console.log("There is no element at index " + x + " in the myFriends array.");
}
    </pre>
    <p>
      There are different syntaxes that you can use when working with arrays.
      We'll go over some of them later, when we talk about array methods.
      But for now I'll just show you another way that you could create an array,
      because you may see this when you look at other people's code
    </p>
    <pre>
var numberArray = new Array(1,3,5,7);

// this is the same as... 
var numberArray = [1,3,5,7];
    </pre>
    <h3>Arrays of Objects</h3>
    <p>
      We have seen that you can put various data types inside of arrays, such as numbers, strings, and booleans.
      Arrays can also store objects. 
      This allows us to model collections of real world objects, which is very useful for processing data in our programs.
      Take a look at this array:
    </p>
    <pre>
var books = [];
books[0] = {title:"Harvey Porter", author:"Rowlings"};
books[1] = {title:"The Sun Also Rises", author:"Hemmingway"};
    </pre>
    <p>
      We start out with an empty array, and then we add an object at the first position (index = 0).
      Then we add another object at the second position (index = 1);
    </p>
    <p>
      This approach required us to write three statements to create and populate the array.
      But we could do it all in a single statement like this (note that I broke the statement up into separate lines just to make it easier to read).
    </p>
    <pre>
var books = [
  {title:"Harvey Porter", author:"Rowlings"},
  {title:"The Sun Also Rises", author:"Hemmingway"}
];
    </pre>
    <p>If you wanted to drill down into this array, and for example, log out the title of the first book, you could do it like this:
    </p>
    <pre>
console.log(books[0].title);

// we could also change the title of the first book like this...
books[0].title = "Henry Popper";
    </pre>
    <p>
    Another common technique is to pull an item out of an array and store it in a variable, like this:
    </p>
    <pre>
var b = books[0]; 
console.log(b.title);

b.title = "Harry Potter";
console.log(books);
    </pre>
    <p>
      We shall soon see that you can write some very powerful programs when you start using arrays of objects!

// Use the following chart to add data to each object
/*

    {size: "small", crust: "thin", topping: "pepperoni"}
];

// console.log(pizzas);
// Now retreive the large pizza from the array, and assign it to a variable named 'firstPizza'. 
var firstpizza = pizzas[0];
// Then use dot notation to change the 'topping' property of firstPizza to a value of 'onions'.
firstpizza.topping = "onions";

// SIDE NOTE: Here's another way that you could change a property of one of the pizza objects:
//
//      pizzas[0].topping = "onions";
//
// You wouldn't need to create the 'firstPizza' variable with this approach

// Finally, log the pizzas variable.
console.log(pizzas);
